    <h3>Prologue:<br><span>The Heretic</span></h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="firstletter">A</span> smile spread across Sigrid the Heretic's face as she sailed into the storm-tossed water. The small lantern tied to her boat's mast flickered and swung as the wind knocked it around, the dim smoky light doing little to help in the storm. Far behind her on the shore came shouts of outrage and indignation. They held up bundles of torches, seeking her in the darkness. She was speeding away now, much further than any torch could reach. She thanked the gods for her luck. Her hard work in drilling holes in the other boats, then filling the holes with porous saw-packing had been rewarded. The men who had taken to those sabotaged boats to catch her seemed to have found their chase short-lived. It pained her that things had ended this way. Though like anything else, Sigrid had been ready for it. She had lived too long with men and women who strayed from what they had once been. Those back on shore had been honorable, once. She had counted them as her own family. And now they would be coming for her, ready to take the only thing in her life that still mattered.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gritting her teeth, Queen Sigrid rowed hard on the oars. She had long since been sweating, though it was difficult to tell through the rain. She worked hard to steer her small boat through the waves in the midst of the storm. She paused for a moment, only to pull on the rope that held her sail in place. The storm winds in this new land were fickle, prone to change direction as soon as she had adjusted her sail. It made for difficult sailing, but she was no novice. The wind whipped around her head as the rain came down in sheets. She looked back on the members of her tribe on the shore, a familiar thrill rose again in her chest. It urged her on, putting as much distance as she could between herself and the people she once called friends.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her tiny ship flew as fast as it could across the water, the prow sputtering against the dark rhythm of the waves. Sigrid was in her element. She had served a fool and chased his errands for too long. Her husband, the King in title alone, had given away everything that made their people free. And now she and her treasure had to leave.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life back in her ancestral home felt like a dream now, a dream that was now an ocean away. Home was far away and long ago, like somewhere you'd read about in one of the fae tales. She had grown up in the same longhouses that her fathers had. She had drank mead with wisest of men and the bravest of women. She had known all of her people, and they had known her. Their lives back home were a comfortable rhythm of history, kinship, and belonging, each year another verse that added to the chorus her people had sung for hundreds of years.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But of late, everything had changed. Her mother, seeking enduring peace for her people, had presented her with an offer of marriage to an upstart calling himself the King of Norrvegr. He sought to unite the disparate Viking clans once and for all, putting them together in a united front under one flag. Sigrid had consented, though only for the good of those she swore to protect. It was a decision she had grown to regret, now that the very people she loved had turned on her. It sickened her now more than ever.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ah yes, I remember when you married the idiot," a voice said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid froze. A woman had appeared in the prow of the boat. She wore a long, white dress that was somehow completely dry, though they were in the midst of a storm. Now that Sigrid noticed it, not even a hair on the woman's head was disheveled, though the wind whipped to and fro.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid could hear the woman's smooth velvet voice. It seemed as if the voice spoke in her head.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That marriage of yours was quite fortuitous indeed. Though not necessarily for you, I'm afraid," the woman said. She tapped her long nails idly against the plank she rested on. She seemed whollyunconcerned with Sigrid and the situation at hand.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid cursed as salty water splashed onto her face. The woman, Verdandi, was a pestilence that she did not need right now. She had enough to deal with without the accursed Norn to slow her down.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell me dear," Verdandi said as she smoothed out the soft, billowing fabric of her dress, "When will you consider that there is no point to all of this?" She gestured across the storm-tossed waters back at the men shouting on the beach. "Have you not learned that these things I have told you will soon come to pass? All of this has been decided long ago. This is a matter of fate, and fate does not change easily," Verdandi said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Then I suppose I must try harder," Sigrid said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For some reason, she thought of her father. She remembered him holding her hand when she splashed in the streams as a babe. He had been a marvelous man, and far beyond his time. A master shipbuilder, he was the first to teach their people how to be seafarers. The old men who knew him the longest claimed he wasn't born, but arrived to their clan as a child who floated in on the waves, in a cradle formed from turtles and seafoam. It was folly, Sigrid knew, but a part of her didn't doubt the stories. The man had been a legend, and he had taught her everything.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rope keeping her ship's sail in place suddenly whipped loose. Cursing, Sigrid stopped rowing and lunged after it. The sheets of rain were falling harder now, and Sigrid shielded her eyes with a hand.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Verdandi stretched luxuriantly across the prow, like a cat stretching in the sunshine. She sighed, completely unfazed by the swirling storm around them.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"You vikings are all alike, you know?" Verdandi said. "You're all stubborn to a fault. I have seen one of your kind bellow at a storm at night, only to wind up frozen to death the next morning. A storm! What did he think he would do, shout it into submission? It's all a show. A lot of chest-thumping and bravado. But where does that ever get you?" She put her palm to her forehead, as if she was remembering something. "Oh! Just a moment," Verdandi said. She brushed the tips of her fingers against the water and grimaced. "Yes, it's just as I feared. She is coming for you, Sigrid. This isn't looking good for you."<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was difficult for Sigrid to hear over the dull roar of the rain, but the Verdandi's words always seemed to reach her ear.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid threw up her hands in exasperation. "Would you please just shut your mouth for one-"<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paused. Verdandi was gone from where she had stretched just a moment before, vanished into thin air.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid cursed. She caught the flyaway rope and tied it back in place. The rope was rough and sodden, but her hands were tough. They had been crafted as tough as leather, as strong as corded twine. The sun and salt and wind had weathered her to a toughness that exceeded that of anyone under her command. That was the way things had always been in her tribe. The best of the best were chosen to lead. Sigrid had been the best, and she had been chosen amid tumultuous cheers. But now she was fleeing the people she had once loved. Had she made the right choice in leaving them?<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She looked down to the bundle strapped to her chest. Under her cloak swaddled tightly against her body was her son. He didn't cry, as one might expect a baby to in this weather. He just looked at her with big, blue eyes. He was still so small. It pained Sigrid that he would never have a normal life, and that he would never be able to know the joy she felt in belonging to the tribe. She would never be able to craft a ship for him, as her father had for her.  He would never be able to experience the joy of leading his people. All of that, the years of tradition, culture, and service to one another had all been thrown away.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid looked back up and froze. The storm around her had ceased, and the ocean and rain were still. She stood up in her small boat, her oar raised by instinct. Was this more of Verdandi's trickery? It seemed possible, but the Norn rarely interfered beyond her witty remarks. But this was different. Something was affecting the real world around her, stilling the ocean and calming the storm. In the dim moonlight, Sigrid scanned the ocean looking for the cause of the sudden stop.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, she saw it. To the side of the boat, bubbles murmured up from the black water. They came to the surface with great, bloated pops. Thousands of them stormed to the surface at once, churning the water to a white froth. Sigrid gripped her oar tighter. This was it, this was the thing they had sent after her.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The bubbles ceased. A seam in the water, little more than a ripple, opened up in front of her. It reminded her of a mouth, and it seemed to grin at her as she stood still in her tiny boat.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Leave us, spirit. You will have nothing from me," Sigrid shouted, still brandishing her oar. She wasn't sure if the thing had even heard her. Frightened by the noise, her son began to whimper in his pouch at her chest.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth in the water widened even further. It gurgled and splashed at the edges. A laugh.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So her suspicions had been right after all.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Tell him I shall not allow him to have a hair on my son's head," Sigrid said. "Move along now."<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mouth shook with mirth. The ocean itself seemed to vibrate as the thing laughed, great waves sloshing back and forth around it.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<em>I am no messenger,</em>" the thing said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid's son began to cry, and she looked down at him. He would not know the fear and lies that had corrupted her people. She would teach him the love, compassion, and kindness that her family had known for generations. For him she would do anything, Norns and Gods be damned.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Whatever you are," Sigrid said to the thing in the water. "You will not have my son. Not in my life."<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing's mouth rippled into one final, wide smile, and it dissolved back into the murky black water.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a rush, Sigrid sat down and rowed hard on the oars. She had to get outside of the circle of peaceful ocean, back into the wind and the fray. In the wind, the sail would carry them out of here.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid rowed hard, but she didn't seem to move. Was the boat starting to spin? Sigrid's stomach lurched. The thing had started a whirlpool.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a larger ship, a whirlpool wouldn't have been a problem. With enough men at the oars and wind in the sails, a concerted effort could easily pull a longboat out of one. But a small ship, manned by a woman and her baby, stuck in a demon's whirlpool? Even though Sigrid had skill, one person could resist the current for only so long before they were lost in the current.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigrid rowed and rowed on the oars, desperate to escape the now-swirling current. The wind was still, making the fight one on one between her rowing and the growing vortex of the whirlpool. Her boat sunk down as the concavity intensified, the swirling current drawing Sigrid's small ship down into its maw.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her son was full-on crying now. Sigrid shushed him as she rowed on the oars, waves splashing viciously around them. She strained and pulled as hard as she could, working against the tug of the water on her boat. There was a practiced rhythm to her rowing, a rhythm learned from years upon years of practice. Hard rowing wasn't necessarily good rowing. That was what her father had always said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was no use. The vortex was swirling deeper now, spinning the little boat around and around in its pitching maelstrom of water. There would be no pulling away from the current that held them.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As they were sucked further into the whirlpool, Sigrid thought she could see the thing in the water. It seemed to be sucking them in with a distended mouth, swallowing everything.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat spun more quickly now. Sigrid lurched over to one side, thrown against the bottom of the boat by the sheer pressure from spinning so quickly. She clambered up onto her knees, clutching her crying son closer to her chest. Inside her, the familiar thrill rose again. She felt a surge of power and conviction unlike anything else she knew, and it was at that moment that she knew what she had to do.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She unwrapped him and held him to her face, kissing him sweetly on the forehead. For a moment she let her kiss linger, drinking in every bit of the moment that she could.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'm sorry I have to leave you, but it's the only way," she said. He cried on, understanding nothing, just a victim of circumstances beyond his control. "I will love you forever and ever, my baby boy," she said.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She tried to distract herself from the tears, making her way over to a small compartment at the base of the mast. It was a small wooden box that held her travel supplies that poor Aela had packed the night before. The thought of her lost friend made her heart hurt, and made what she had to do next all the more painful.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst a bundle of straw, in the tough wooden crate, Sigrid tucked in her son, Prince Tornir. His little arms reached for her as she let him go, nestling him amongst the food and dry straw for kindling that Aela had packed for them. Tears streamed unbidden from her eyes now. In the maw of the demon's maelstrom, all Sigrid could think about was her son. He would be unprotected, alone, and crying. She wouldn't be there to comfort him, nor would he ever know who she was.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was still better than the alternative. Sigrid would not let the demon take him, not while she still lived. With sorrow, love, and conviction in her heart, Sigrid closed the wooden lid of the crate and latched it shut gently. Perhaps there would be fishermen about, or maybe some of the people native to the land would find him and raise him as their own. There was a chance, of course, that he would just be washed back to the tribe that Sigrid had tried so desperately to escape from.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a chance at life was better than certain death. With her boat nearly vertical at the bottom of the spinning maelstrom, Sigrid stood and faced the thing at the bottom.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If she didn't act now, the thing would swallow both her and her son. It would drown them both in the cold, black water. Her son would die helpless and alone. Sigrid wasn't going to let that happen. She pulled the long, gleaming sword from the sheath slung over her shoulder. The near-white metal glittered pearlescent in the moonlight. A final gift from her father, the sword was supposedly forged from the metal in a meteorite. He had always claimed the sword's innate sharpness and silver glow were because it was a gift from Odin himself. Sigrid had never believed his superstition about the blade, but she found herself hoping that he was right after all.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said a prayer to herself as she strode down to the edge of the deck. The prayer was to the old gods of their homeland, gods that her ancestors revered. Sigrid thought she could see the thing grimace and pull harder at the whirlpool, all the more eager to suck her in and drown her prayers. The thrill rose even higher within her until she could hear it pounding in her ears. She could feel her heartbeat in her face and in her fingers. The surge of the maelstrom sprayed water over her face, the thundering sound of the vortex sucking the both of them to oblivion. Every inch of her was ready to fight, even ready to die, if it meant saving her boy.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a shout of defiance, she jumped off the boat and into the center of the thing in the deep, sword outstretched.<br><br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a blinding flash, as if lightning had struck. Then everything fell to black.</p><br><br>
